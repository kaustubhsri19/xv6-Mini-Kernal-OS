# Grep Command Verification Test Plan

## Test Cases for xv6 Grep Implementation

### 1. Basic Pattern Matching Tests
```bash
# Test 1: Simple text search
echo "hello world" | grep "hello"
# Expected: "hello world"

# Test 2: Case sensitive search
echo "Hello World" | grep "hello"  
# Expected: No output (case sensitive)

# Test 3: Multiple lines
echo -e "line1\nline2\nline3" | grep "line2"
# Expected: "line2"
```

### 2. Regex Pattern Tests
```bash
# Test 4: Beginning of line (^)
echo -e "start\nnot start" | grep "^start"
# Expected: "start"

# Test 5: Any character (.)
echo "cat bat hat" | grep ".at"
# Expected: "cat bat hat"

# Test 6: Zero or more (*)
echo "a aa aaa" | grep "a*"
# Expected: "a aa aaa"

# Test 7: End of line ($)
echo -e "end\nnot end" | grep "end$"
# Expected: "end"
```

### 3. File Input Tests
```bash
# Test 8: Search in specific file
echo "test content" > test.txt
grep "test" test.txt
# Expected: "test content"

# Test 9: Multiple files
echo "file1 content" > file1.txt
echo "file2 content" > file2.txt
grep "content" file1.txt file2.txt
# Expected: Both lines with "content"
```

### 4. Edge Cases
```bash
# Test 10: Empty pattern
echo "test" | grep ""
# Expected: "test" (matches everything)

# Test 11: No matches
echo "hello" | grep "world"
# Expected: No output

# Test 12: Empty file
touch empty.txt
grep "anything" empty.txt
# Expected: No output
```

### 5. Error Handling Tests
```bash
# Test 13: No arguments
grep
# Expected: "usage: grep pattern [file ...]"

# Test 14: Non-existent file
grep "test" nonexistent.txt
# Expected: "grep: cannot open nonexistent.txt"
```

## Implementation Verification Checklist

### ✅ Code Quality Checks:
- [ ] Proper argument parsing
- [ ] File descriptor management (open/close)
- [ ] Buffer management (1024 byte buffer)
- [ ] Line-by-line processing
- [ ] Regex pattern matching
- [ ] Error handling for file operations
- [ ] Memory safety (no buffer overflows)

### ✅ Functionality Checks:
- [ ] Basic text search works
- [ ] Regex patterns (^, ., *, $) work correctly
- [ ] Multiple file support
- [ ] Stdin input support
- [ ] Proper output formatting
- [ ] Error messages are clear

### ✅ Performance Checks:
- [ ] Handles large files efficiently
- [ ] Memory usage is reasonable
- [ ] No memory leaks
- [ ] Fast pattern matching
